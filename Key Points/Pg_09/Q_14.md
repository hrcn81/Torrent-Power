# 14. Methods of System Earthing and Equipment Earthing

## Introduction
Earthing is an essential aspect of electrical systems to ensure safety, protect equipment, and maintain proper functioning. There are two primary types of earthing: system earthing and equipment earthing. Here's an overview of the methods used for each:

## System Earthing

### 1. Neutral Earthing
- **Purpose:** Connects the neutral point of transformers and generators to the earth.
- **Methods:**
  - **Solid Earthing:** Direct connection of the neutral point to earth.
  - **Resistance Earthing:** Insertion of a resistance between the neutral point and earth to limit fault currents.
  - **Reactance Earthing:** Insertion of a reactance (inductance or capacitance) between the neutral point and earth to limit fault currents.
- **Benefits:** Stabilizes voltage levels, limits fault currents, and provides a reference point for system operation.

### 2. Zone Substation Earthing
- **Purpose:** Earthing of zone substations to ensure safety and fault protection.
- **Methods:**
  - **Grid Earthing:** Interconnection of all metallic structures and equipment within the substation to a common earth grid.
  - **Local Earthing:** Earthing of individual equipment and structures using earth electrodes or rods.
- **Benefits:** Provides low impedance path for fault currents, reduces touch and step voltages, and ensures personnel safety.

## Equipment Earthing

### 1. Direct Equipment Earthing
- **Purpose:** Ensures all metallic parts of electrical equipment are connected to the earth.
- **Methods:**
  - **Direct Connection:** Metallic parts of equipment are connected directly to the earth using conductors or straps.
- **Benefits:** Prevents potential differences that can cause electric shock and ensures safe operation of equipment.

### 2. Equipment Frame Earthing
- **Purpose:** Earthing of equipment frames or enclosures to prevent electric shock and ensure safety.
- **Methods:**
  - **Frame Bonding:** Bonding all metallic parts of equipment to a common earth point using conductors or straps.
- **Benefits:** Provides equipotential bonding, reduces electromagnetic interference, and ensures personnel safety.

### 3. Cable Sheath Earthing
- **Purpose:** Earthing of cable sheaths to prevent electromagnetic interference and ensure safety.
- **Methods:**
  - **Sheath Connection:** Connection of cable sheaths to earth at regular intervals along the cable route.
- **Benefits:** Limits induced voltages on cables, reduces electromagnetic interference, and ensures safe operation of equipment.

## Conclusion
System earthing and equipment earthing are crucial for the safe and reliable operation of electrical systems. By employing appropriate earthing methods, electrical installations can mitigate the risks associated with fault currents, protect equipment from damage, and ensure the safety of personnel.
