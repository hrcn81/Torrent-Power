# 10. Commissioning Tests of Power Transformers

## Introduction
Commissioning tests are performed on power transformers to ensure they are in proper working condition before being put into service. These tests help in identifying any manufacturing defects, transportation damages, or installation issues. This document outlines the various commissioning tests that should be conducted on power transformers.

## 1. Visual and Mechanical Inspection

### Purpose
To check for any physical damage, proper assembly, and overall condition of the transformer and its components.

### Procedure
1. Inspect the transformer body for dents, rust, or signs of oil leakage.
2. Verify that all fittings, accessories, and connections are properly installed.
3. Check the condition of bushings, radiators, and conservator.
4. Ensure all bolts, nuts, and clamps are properly tightened.
5. Confirm the correct labeling and identification of terminals and components.

## 2. Insulation Resistance Test

### Purpose
To measure the insulation resistance of the transformer windings to ensure there are no insulation breakdowns.

### Procedure
1. Disconnect the transformer from the system.
2. Use a megohmmeter to measure the resistance between:
   - HV winding and ground.
   - LV winding and ground.
   - HV and LV windings.
3. Compare the readings with manufacturer’s specifications and record the values.

## 3. Transformer Turns Ratio (TTR) Test

### Purpose
To verify the turns ratio between the primary and secondary windings, ensuring it matches the design specifications.

### Procedure
1. Connect the TTR test set to the primary and secondary windings.
2. Apply the test voltage and measure the turns ratio.
3. Compare the measured ratio with the specified ratio and document the results.

## 4. Winding Resistance Test

### Purpose
To measure the DC resistance of the transformer windings, detecting issues like loose connections or winding damage.

### Procedure
1. Use a winding resistance meter.
2. Measure the resistance of the HV and LV windings.
3. Compare the readings with the manufacturer’s specifications and record the values.

## 5. Dielectric Tests

### 5.1. Power Frequency Withstand Test
- **Purpose:** To verify the insulation strength of the transformer under high voltage conditions.
- **Procedure:** Apply a high voltage (typically 2-3 times the rated voltage) for a specified duration and check for any breakdowns.

### 5.2. Induced Overvoltage Withstand Test
- **Purpose:** To verify the insulation between windings.
- **Procedure:** Apply a high voltage at double the rated frequency for a specified duration and check for insulation breakdowns.

## 6. Oil Tests

### 6.1. Dielectric Strength Test
- **Purpose:** To assess the dielectric strength of the transformer oil.
- **Procedure:** Collect an oil sample, test it using a dielectric breakdown voltage test set, and compare with standard values.

### 6.2. Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA)
- **Purpose:** To detect the presence of gases dissolved in the transformer oil, indicating internal arcing, overheating, or other issues.
- **Procedure:** Collect an oil sample, analyze it using gas chromatography, identify and quantify the gases present, and compare with standard limits.

## 7. Measurement of Impedance and Load Loss

### Purpose
To measure the impedance and load loss of the transformer, ensuring they match the design specifications.

### Procedure
1. Connect the transformer to a power source.
2. Apply a load and measure the impedance and load loss.
3. Compare the measured values with the specified values and document the results.

## 8. Temperature Rise Test

### Purpose
To verify the cooling performance and temperature rise of the transformer under load conditions.

### Procedure
1. Apply a specified load to the transformer.
2. Measure the temperature rise of the windings and oil.
3. Compare the results with the design specifications and record the values.

## 9. Frequency Response Analysis (FRA)

### Purpose
To detect mechanical changes or deformations in the winding structure.

### Procedure
1. Connect the FRA equipment to the transformer terminals.
2. Apply a sweep frequency signal and record the response.
3. Compare the results with baseline data or manufacturer specifications.

## 10. Bushing Tests

### Purpose
To measure the insulation resistance and capacitance of transformer bushings, ensuring they are not degraded.

### Procedure
1. Use a bushing tester.
2. Measure the insulation resistance and capacitance of each bushing.
3. Compare the results with standard values and previous measurements.

## 11. On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC) Operation Test

### Purpose
To ensure the proper functioning of the on-load tap changer, which adjusts the transformer’s voltage ratio under load.

### Procedure
1. Operate the tap changer through all positions.
2. Check for smooth operation and correct position indication.
3. Inspect for any signs of wear, damage, or contact erosion.

## 12. Functional Tests

### Purpose
To verify the correct operation of all protective devices, alarms, and control circuits.

### Procedure
1. Test all protective relays, alarms, and control circuits.
2. Ensure correct operation and response to fault conditions.
3. Document all test results and verify against specifications.

## Conclusion
Commissioning tests are vital for ensuring the reliability and safety of power transformers before they are put into service. By conducting these tests, potential issues can be identified and addressed promptly, ensuring the transformer operates efficiently and safely within the electrical system.
