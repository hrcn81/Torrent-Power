# 5. Time Grading of IDMTL Relays

## Introduction
Inverse Definite Minimum Time Lag (IDMTL) relays are widely used in electrical protection systems for overcurrent protection. These relays operate with a time delay that is inversely proportional to the fault current. Time grading of IDMTL relays is a critical process to ensure coordinated operation of protection devices, preventing unnecessary tripping and ensuring selective isolation of faulted sections.

## Principles of IDMTL Relays

### Inverse Time Characteristic
- The operating time decreases as the fault current increases.
- Provides faster tripping for higher fault currents, ensuring quick isolation.

### Definite Minimum Time
- A minimum operating time is set to avoid instantaneous tripping for small overcurrents.
- Ensures stability and prevents nuisance tripping.

## Time Grading Concept

### Objective
To coordinate the operation of multiple relays in a protection scheme, ensuring that the relay closest to the fault operates first, followed by upstream relays if the fault persists.

### Steps in Time Grading

1. **Identify Relay Locations:**
   - Identify the locations of all IDMTL relays in the system, from the source to the load.

2. **Determine Fault Levels:**
   - Calculate or obtain the fault current levels at each relay location.

3. **Set Relay Characteristics:**
   - Select appropriate inverse time characteristics for each relay (e.g., standard inverse, very inverse, extremely inverse).

4. **Calculate Operating Times:**
   - For each relay, calculate the operating time for the expected fault current levels using the relayâ€™s time-current characteristic curve.

5. **Apply Time Delays:**
   - Apply time delays to upstream relays to ensure coordinated tripping. The delay ensures that the downstream relay has sufficient time to operate before the upstream relay.

6. **Check Coordination:**
   - Verify the coordination by ensuring that the time margin between relays is adequate (typically 0.2 to 0.4 seconds).

### Example of Time Grading

Consider a simple radial feeder with three IDMTL relays (R1, R2, R3) located as follows:
- R1: Near the load
- R2: Midpoint
- R3: Near the source

1. **Fault at Load (Near R1):**
   - R1 should operate first with the shortest time delay.
   - R2 and R3 should have time delays to allow R1 to clear the fault.

2. **Fault at Midpoint (Near R2):**
   - R2 should operate first.
   - R3 should have a longer time delay to allow R2 to clear the fault.
   - R1 should not operate for faults upstream of its location.

### Relay Settings Example

- **Relay R1:**
  - Fault current: 500A
  - Characteristic: Very Inverse
  - Operating Time: 0.5 seconds

- **Relay R2:**
  - Fault current: 500A (same fault current at R2 location)
  - Characteristic: Very Inverse
  - Operating Time: 0.7 seconds (includes 0.2-second time margin over R1)

- **Relay R3:**
  - Fault current: 500A (same fault current at R3 location)
  - Characteristic: Very Inverse
  - Operating Time: 0.9 seconds (includes 0.2-second time margin over R2)

## Factors Affecting Time Grading

### Fault Current Levels
- Higher fault currents require shorter operating times for downstream relays.

### Relay Characteristic Curves
- The selection of inverse time characteristics (standard, very, extremely inverse) affects coordination.

### Time Margins
- Adequate time margins between relays ensure proper coordination and prevent simultaneous tripping.

### System Configuration
- Complex network configurations may require more sophisticated coordination techniques.

## Conclusion
Time grading of IDMTL relays is essential for achieving selective coordination in electrical protection systems. By carefully setting and coordinating the operating times of relays based on fault current levels and system configuration, protection engineers can ensure reliable and efficient isolation of faulted sections, minimizing the impact on the overall system.
