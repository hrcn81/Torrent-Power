# 7. Working of Various Types of Circuit Breakers (CBs)

## Introduction
Circuit breakers (CBs) are crucial components in electrical systems, designed to protect circuits from overloads and short circuits by interrupting the flow of current. Different types of circuit breakers are used based on the application, voltage levels, and the type of current they need to interrupt. This document outlines the working principles of various types of circuit breakers.

## 1. Air Circuit Breakers (ACB)

### Working Principle
Air circuit breakers use air as the arc extinguishing medium. When the contacts separate during a fault condition, an arc is formed. The arc is extinguished by a blast of air.

### Operation
1. **Normal Operation:**
   - The contacts of the breaker are closed, allowing current to flow through the circuit.

2. **Fault Condition:**
   - When a fault occurs, the trip unit activates, causing the contacts to separate.
   - An arc forms between the separating contacts.

3. **Arc Extinguishing:**
   - A blast of compressed air is directed at the arc, cooling and stretching it until it extinguishes.

4. **Contact Reclosure:**
   - After the fault is cleared, the contacts can be manually or automatically reset to resume normal operation.

### Applications
- Low and medium voltage applications.
- Industrial plants and commercial buildings.

## 2. Vacuum Circuit Breakers (VCB)

### Working Principle
Vacuum circuit breakers extinguish the arc in a vacuum. When the contacts separate, the arc forms and is quickly extinguished as the metal vapors, electrons, and ions produced during the arc rapidly condense on the contact surfaces.

### Operation
1. **Normal Operation:**
   - Contacts are closed, allowing current to flow.

2. **Fault Condition:**
   - Trip unit causes the contacts to separate.
   - An arc forms in the vacuum.

3. **Arc Extinguishing:**
   - The arc is extinguished as the particles condense on the contact surfaces, quickly quenching the arc.

4. **Contact Reclosure:**
   - Contacts can be reset after clearing the fault.

### Applications
- Medium voltage applications.
- Power distribution and industrial applications.

## 3. SF6 Circuit Breakers

### Working Principle
SF6 circuit breakers use sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas to extinguish the arc. SF6 is an electronegative gas with excellent insulating and arc-quenching properties.

### Operation
1. **Normal Operation:**
   - Contacts are closed, allowing current to flow.

2. **Fault Condition:**
   - Trip unit causes the contacts to separate.
   - An arc forms between the contacts in the SF6 gas environment.

3. **Arc Extinguishing:**
   - The arc is quenched as the SF6 gas absorbs the electrons, creating a non-conductive path and extinguishing the arc.

4. **Contact Reclosure:**
   - Contacts can be reset after clearing the fault.

### Applications
- High voltage applications.
- Power transmission and distribution.

## 4. Oil Circuit Breakers (OCB)

### Working Principle
Oil circuit breakers use oil as both the arc extinguishing and insulating medium. When the contacts separate, the arc vaporizes the surrounding oil, creating a gas bubble that extinguishes the arc.

### Operation
1. **Normal Operation:**
   - Contacts are closed, allowing current to flow.

2. **Fault Condition:**
   - Trip unit causes the contacts to separate.
   - An arc forms and vaporizes the surrounding oil.

3. **Arc Extinguishing:**
   - The vaporized oil forms a gas bubble that displaces the oil, quenching the arc.

4. **Contact Reclosure:**
   - Contacts can be reset after clearing the fault.

### Applications
- Medium and high voltage applications.
- Power generation and distribution.

## 5. Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCB)

### Working Principle
Miniature circuit breakers use a thermal or thermal-magnetic mechanism to interrupt the circuit. They are commonly used for low voltage applications.

### Operation
1. **Normal Operation:**
   - Contacts are closed, allowing current to flow.

2. **Overload Condition:**
   - Thermal element (bimetallic strip) heats up and bends, causing the contacts to open.

3. **Short Circuit Condition:**
   - Magnetic element generates a magnetic field, causing the contacts to open instantly.

4. **Arc Extinguishing:**
   - Arc is extinguished in an arc chute, cooling and splitting the arc into smaller segments.

5. **Contact Reclosure:**
   - Contacts can be reset manually after clearing the fault.

### Applications
- Residential and commercial electrical systems.
- Low voltage circuits and appliances.

## 6. Molded Case Circuit Breakers (MCCB)

### Working Principle
Molded case circuit breakers use a thermal-magnetic mechanism similar to MCBs but are designed for higher current ratings and are used in both low and medium voltage applications.

### Operation
1. **Normal Operation:**
   - Contacts are closed, allowing current to flow.

2. **Overload Condition:**
   - Thermal element heats up and causes the contacts to open.

3. **Short Circuit Condition:**
   - Magnetic element creates a magnetic field that trips the contacts instantly.

4. **Arc Extinguishing:**
   - Arc is extinguished in an arc chute.

5. **Contact Reclosure:**
   - Contacts can be reset manually after clearing the fault.

### Applications
- Industrial and commercial electrical systems.
- Low and medium voltage circuits.

## Conclusion
Different types of circuit breakers are used to protect electrical systems based on the application requirements, voltage levels, and current ratings. Understanding the working principles of various circuit breakers helps in selecting the right type for specific applications, ensuring effective protection and reliability of the electrical system.
