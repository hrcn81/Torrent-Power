# 8. Routine Tests to be Conducted on Power Transformers

## Introduction
Routine tests are essential for ensuring the reliability, performance, and safety of power transformers. These tests are conducted periodically to detect potential issues early and maintain the transformer's optimal operating condition. This document outlines the various routine tests that should be conducted on power transformers.

## 1. Visual Inspection

### Purpose
To check for any physical damage, oil leaks, and the condition of external components.

### Procedure
1. Inspect the transformer body for dents, rust, or signs of oil leakage.
2. Check the condition of bushings, radiators, and conservator.
3. Verify the integrity of gaskets, seals, and bolts.
4. Ensure proper labeling and signage are intact.

## 2. Insulation Resistance Test

### Purpose
To measure the insulation resistance of the transformer windings and ensure there are no insulation breakdowns.

### Procedure
1. Disconnect the transformer from the system.
2. Use a megohmmeter to measure the resistance between:
   - HV winding and ground.
   - LV winding and ground.
   - HV and LV windings.
3. Compare the readings with previous values and manufacturer's specifications.

## 3. Transformer Turns Ratio (TTR) Test

### Purpose
To verify the turns ratio between the primary and secondary windings, ensuring it matches the design specifications.

### Procedure
1. Connect the TTR test set to the primary and secondary windings.
2. Apply the test voltage and measure the turns ratio.
3. Compare the measured ratio with the specified ratio.

## 4. Winding Resistance Test

### Purpose
To measure the DC resistance of the transformer windings, detecting issues like loose connections or winding damage.

### Procedure
1. Use a winding resistance meter.
2. Measure the resistance of the HV and LV windings.
3. Compare the readings with the manufacturer's specifications and previous results.

## 5. Oil Dielectric Strength Test

### Purpose
To assess the dielectric strength of the transformer oil, ensuring it can effectively insulate and cool the transformer.

### Procedure
1. Collect an oil sample from the transformer.
2. Use an oil dielectric breakdown voltage test set.
3. Measure the breakdown voltage and compare it with standard values.

## 6. Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA)

### Purpose
To detect the presence of gases dissolved in the transformer oil, which can indicate internal arcing, overheating, or other issues.

### Procedure
1. Collect an oil sample from the transformer.
2. Analyze the sample using gas chromatography.
3. Identify and quantify the gases present.
4. Compare the results with standard limits and previous data.

## 7. Power Factor/Tan Delta Test

### Purpose
To measure the insulation quality and detect moisture, contamination, or insulation deterioration.

### Procedure
1. Use a power factor test set.
2. Measure the power factor (tan delta) of the HV and LV windings.
3. Compare the results with standard values and historical data.

## 8. Frequency Response Analysis (FRA)

### Purpose
To detect mechanical changes or deformations in the winding structure.

### Procedure
1. Connect the FRA equipment to the transformer terminals.
2. Apply a sweep frequency signal and record the response.
3. Compare the results with baseline data or manufacturer specifications.

## 9. Bushing Insulation Test

### Purpose
To measure the insulation resistance of transformer bushings, ensuring they are not degraded.

### Procedure
1. Use a megohmmeter.
2. Measure the insulation resistance of each bushing.
3. Compare the results with standard values and previous measurements.

## 10. Load Tap Changer (LTC) Operation Test

### Purpose
To ensure the proper functioning of the load tap changer, which adjusts the transformer's voltage ratio under load.

### Procedure
1. Operate the tap changer through all positions.
2. Check for smooth operation and correct position indication.
3. Inspect for any signs of wear, damage, or contact erosion.

## Conclusion
Routine tests are vital for maintaining the health and performance of power transformers. By regularly conducting these tests, potential issues can be identified and addressed promptly, ensuring the longevity and reliability of the transformer.
